                <p class="blog-agile2">I shook my head no.

"Lucky you." He smiled.

I grabbed my clean underwear, blue adidas shorts and white T-shirt, vaguely told him "I'll be right back," and rushed into the bathroom. That's not a good first impression.

"Where are your parents? I asked from the bathroom.

"My parents? Dad is currently in California, probably sitting on a rocking chair or driving a truck. My mom probably just left campus right now."

"Oh." I returned dressed, not knowing how to respond to such a personal message. Maybe, if I don't want to know, I shouldn't ask at first.

Chip grabbed the sheet and threw it on top. "" I like sleeping on top and hope you don't mind.

"Well, it doesn't matter. I sleep everywhere."

"You seem to have arranged here." He pointed to the world map and said, "I love it."

Then he began to name the countries of the world. He read it in a flat tone, as if he knew it by heart.

Afghanistan.

Albania.

Algeria.

American Samoa.

Andorra.

......

After reciting the country name at the beginning of A, he looked up and noticed my incredulous eyes.

"I can recite the rest of the names, but I think you will get bored. This is a trick I learned during the summer vacation. You can't imagine how boring Alabama's new hope city is in the summer, any more than watching soybeans grow. By the way, where did you come from?"

"Florida.

"I've never been there."

"It's great. It's country culture or something."

"Well, everyone has a specialty, like I'm good at remembering things. How about you?"

"Well, I know a lot of people's last words." Dying is my hobby. I like the fact that these dead people are dying, just like everyone else likes chocolate.

"Let's say "

"I like Ibsen's last words. He's a playwright." I know a lot about Ibsen, but I haven't read any of his plays. I don't like to read drama. I like to read biography.

"Well, I know who he is." Chip said.

"Well, er He had been ill for a long time before he died. One day the nurse said to him, 'you seem much better this morning.' Ibsen looked at her and said, 'just the opposite.

"That's a pervert, but I like it," kip said with a laugh.

He told me that he was in his third year at carver river high school, and that he had been there since the ninth grade -- the first year of high school -- and that he was now in the third year of high school, like me. He is a student on full scholarship. He had heard it was the best school in Alabama, and had written his autobiography as an application, saying he wanted very much to go to a school where he could read large hardback books. In his autobiography, he mentioned his problems: his father always liked to beat him with his family's books, so he had to keep some small paperbacks for his own safety. His parents divorced in his second year of high school. Chip likes "the river," as he calls the school, but says: "you have to be careful here, both with your students and with your teachers. I hate to be so careful." He gave a contemptuous smile. I also hate to be careful - or, at least, I hope so.

As he spoke, he opened his duffel bag and, brusquely, tossed his clothes into the drawer of his wardrobe. It seemed that there was no need to distinguish between the sock drawer and the T-shirt drawer. He believed that all drawers were created equal, anything could be put in as long as it was appropriate, and my mother would pass out if she saw it.

"I hope you're not as soft as you look," he said, patting me roughly on the shoulder after he finished unpacking. Then he went out without closing the door. In a few seconds he poked his head in again, and when he saw me standing where I was, he said, "hey, why are you standing there? Come on, we've got a lot to do."

We went to the TV room. According to chip, there's the only cable in the school. During the summer vacation, it was used as a storage room, stacked with sofas, refrigerators, rolled carpets and so on, almost to the ceiling. The TV room was flooded with students who wanted to find and pull out their belongings, and chip greeted several of them without introducing me. As he threaded his way through the maze of couches, I stood near the door, as far as I could to avoid the couples who dragged the furniture out of the narrow entrance.

It took ten minutes for chip to find his things, and then we spent another ten minutes making four trips up and down the round square of the dormitory between the TV room and room 43. At the end, I was so tired that I wanted to climb into chip's small refrigerator and sleep for a thousand years, but chip didn't seem to feel tired or headache at all.
